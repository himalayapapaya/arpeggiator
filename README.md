# arpeggiator
This is a terminal program which can be used to create and play audio files from scratch. After navigating into the 'src' directory, simply press 'arpeggiator' and then enter and the application will begin. An arpeggio in music theory is simply a chord which is broken up into its subsequent notes. When played in succession, arpeggios can sound musical and  can highly varying characteristics. Two types of arpeggios can be generated, along with customizable attributes such as speed, randomness, and starting note. The .wav file which is created is made by using digital signal processing techniques, creating a saw wave with decay to create a pleasant synth sound. The outputed .wav file is approximately 8 seconds long and can be found in the 'out' folder. There are two examples already in the 'out' folder, with different types of scales and arpeggio speeds.
